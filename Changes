Revision history for Terminal-ReadKey

{{$NEXT}}
    - Deleted some redundant (incorrect) "cooked" key sequences
      [bugfix] Eliminate error inside async thread due to wrong return type
      Test for return type fix.
      (Thanks to @jmaslak who reported and supplied a fix and test!)
      Change default :echo parameter for with-termios() sub to match key-press() since it is now exported.
      Add a few cooked key sequences I missed earlier. (Shift Up, Shift Down, Shift Right, Shift Left, Shift Center)
